Those are the codes I've built for my thesis at Salvador University (UNIFACS). The name of this tool is Knowledge HUB (KHUB) and its purpose is educational. The idea is to share references (knowledge) between students inside or outside the classroom, thus helping students's learning or professors's teaching.
